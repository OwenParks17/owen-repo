    A software that I regularly use that I personally find well designed is the IOS
operating system on my Apple iPhone. A well designed software is something that
effectively serves it’s purpose to it’s intended user. Me, being the intended user of
IOS I find that it performs extremely well in any task I must use it for. An important
aspect of a well designed software is stability and performance. There are very
few cases where I have experienced any kind of crashing or instability while using
my iPhone and I believe that this is due to IOS being a very well designed
software. It takes a lot of skill and attention to detail to develop a software
especially an operating system with such a high level of stability. IOS is used by
millions of people around the world which is why Software Design is an extremely
important aspect and developers must ensure that it be designed in a way where it
can effectively serve it’s purpose effectively, be stable and remain reliable. This is
why I believe Apple’s IOS operating system for the iPhone to be an amazing
example of well designed software.

  During the requirements gathering stage of software development 
  it is important for developers to interview and ask questions with the customers who are going to be using the software. 
  Developers need to gather a list of requirements and features that the software will have. This ensures that the customers are happy with the     
  product they receive and that the software is able to satisfy all of the needs of the user. This is an important step of the software development 
  process that must be completed prior to beginning development. With a complete list of requirements the developers can then begin the development 
  process with a complete understanding of the design of the software.

As a iPhone user, I want a intuitive easy to use user interface with accessibility features, so that the software is accessible to anyone.
